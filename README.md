# PLI_Check
A Windows application to allow users to have designs with perfect intersections

## How it works
1.	Double click on the .exe file.
 
2. Click on the respective Browse buttons for setting the Parent directory and Target Directory
Parent Directory: Path where graphic files to be checked are placed
Target Directory: Path where tested files are placed after Check

3. Click on the Check tab to run the tool.
This will copy individual graphics files in the parent directory to the target directory and check for improper process line intersections.

4. After check is completed a message “Check Completed” is displayed.

5. Now open the files in the Target directory and correct the improper process line intersection.

NOTE: There could be marking made on other line intersection on objects which needs to be ignored. Only process line intersection should be checked and saved.
